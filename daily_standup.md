### The Daily Stand-up, also known as the Daily Scrum, is a short and focused meeting that is held every day during a sprint in the Scrum framework. Its purpose is to facilitate communication, coordination, and transparency within the development team. Here's an overview of what a Daily Stand-up entails:

### Time and Format: The Daily Stand-up is time-boxed to a maximum of 15 minutes. It is typically held at the same time and place each day, preferably in the morning, to set the stage for the day's work. Participants stand up during the meeting to keep it concise and avoid unnecessary discussions.

### Attendees: The meeting involves the development team members who are actively working on the project. The Scrum Master facilitates the meeting but doesn't actively participate unless there is a need to provide clarification or remove impediments. The product owner may attend as an observer but usually doesn't actively participate unless there is a specific need.

### Three Questions: Each team member answers three key questions in a concise manner:

#### what did I do yesterday? Team members share a brief update on the work they completed since the last Daily Stand-up.

#### What will I do today? They communicate their intended tasks or activities for the day, outlining the work they plan to accomplish.

#### Are there any impediments or challenges? Team members highlight any obstacles, issues, or dependencies that may hinder their progress. These impediments are discussed briefly, and the Scrum Master or other team members may take note to address them after the meeting.

### Focus on Collaboration: The Daily Stand-up is not a status report to the Scrum Master or product owner. Instead, it fosters collaboration among team members. If one team member's update raises a need for collaboration or assistance, other team members may offer help or provide suggestions to address the challenge.

### Alignment and Transparency: The Daily Stand-up ensures that everyone is aware of each other's progress, plans, and potential obstacles. It helps identify any potential deviations from the sprint goal or plan and promotes transparency within the team.

### Adaptation and Follow-up: If any issues or impediments are identified during the meeting, the Scrum Master may note them for further discussion or resolution after the Daily Stand-up. Team members can also synchronize with each other outside the meeting to address dependencies or collaborate on tasks.

### The Daily Stand-up acts as a daily synchronization point for the development team. By sharing updates, identifying potential issues, and fostering collaboration, it helps team members stay aligned, identify and resolve impediments, and make adjustments to meet the sprint goal.
